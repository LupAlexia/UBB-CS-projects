# Proper Trench Coats ‚Äì C++ & Qt Shopping Application

A modern C++ application with a Qt GUI for managing and purchasing trench coats from a virtual fashion store. The app supports both **administrator** and **user** modes, with full support for undo/redo, data validation, persistent file storage, and graphical table view of the shopping basket.

> üéì Developed as part of my first-year Computer Science OOP course at UBB.

## Architecture

- **Layered Architecture:**
  - **Domain Layer** ‚Äì Entity classes (`TrenchCoat`)
  - **Repository Layer** ‚Äì File & memory repository with validation
  - **Service Layer** ‚Äì Business logic, undo/redo manager
  - **UI Layer** ‚Äì Qt GUI + CLI

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Command pattern (for undo/redo)
  - MVC with Qt's model/view
  - Inheritance & Polymorphism (basket format, undo commands)

## üß™ Testing

- Uses custom test suite for all non-UI layers
- Unit tests for repository, service, and validator layers
- ‚â• 98% test coverage (excluding UI)
