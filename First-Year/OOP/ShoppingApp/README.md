# 🧥 Proper Trench Coats – C++ & Qt Shopping Application

A modern C++ application with a Qt GUI for managing and purchasing trench coats from a virtual fashion store. The app supports both **administrator** and **user** modes, with full support for undo/redo, data validation, persistent file storage, and graphical table view of the shopping basket.

> 🎓 Developed as part of my first-year Computer Science OOP course at UBB.

## 🚀 Features

### 👨‍💼 Administrator Mode
- Add new trench coats with attributes: `size`, `colour`, `price`, `quantity`, `photo URL`
- Update existing trench coats
- Delete trench coats from inventory

- Persistent file storage (text file using `iostream`)
- Input validation & custom exceptions
- Undo/Redo functionality for add, delete, and update operations

### 🛍️ User Mode

## 🧱 Architecture

- **Layered Architecture:**
  - **Domain Layer** – Entity classes (`TrenchCoat`)
  - **Repository Layer** – File & memory repository with validation
  - **Service Layer** – Business logic, undo/redo manager
  - **UI Layer** – Qt GUI + CLI

- **Design Patterns:**
  - Command pattern (for undo/redo)
  - MVC with Qt's model/view
  - Inheritance & Polymorphism (basket format, undo commands)

## 🧪 Testing

- Uses custom test suite for all non-UI layers
- Unit tests for repository, service, and validator layers
- ≥ 98% test coverage (excluding UI)
