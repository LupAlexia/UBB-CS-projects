# Connect Four game - Python application

This repository contains my implementation of the Connect Four game developed as part of my first-year Computer Science FP(Fundamentals of Programming) course at UBB. The game is console-based and provides a computer opponent that employs optimized AI logic to challenge the player.

## Game Description
Connect Four is a two-player strategy game where players take turns dropping colored discs into a vertically suspended 7-column, 6-row grid. The objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs.

## Features
- Object-Oriented Design: The project follows a modular, layered architecture.
- Console UI: You can play the game in a text-based interface.
- Human vs Computer Gameplay: Challenge an optimized AI that makes strategic moves to win or block the player.
- Input Validation: The game validates and handles all user input errors gracefully.
- Unit Testing: Includes PyUnit test cases and method specifications for non-trivial components.
- AI Strategy: Minimax algorithm used for smarter play.
